    <h3>No St. Patrick's Day is complete without corned beef</h3>
    <p>It's as much of an Irish tradition as wearing green!</p>
    <p>If the hands-off cooking methods and fall-apart tender meat doesn't make corned beef an annual tradition at your house,
    we don't know what will!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) corned beef brisket with spice packet</li>
        <li>10 small red potatoes</li>
        <li>5 medium carrots</li>
        <li>1 large head cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place corned beef in a Dutch oven and cover with water. Add spice packet, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and
        simmer until corned beef is just about fork-tender, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>While the corned beef is simmering, cut potatoes in half. Peel carrots and cut into 3-inch pieces. Cut cabbage into
        small wedges.</li>
        <li>When corned beef has cooked for 2 hours, add potatoes and carrots; cook until vegetables are almost tender and meat is
        fork-tender, about 10 minutes. Add cabbage and cook until tender, about 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove meat and let rest for 15 minutes. Leave broth and vegetables in the Dutch oven.Slice meat across the grain. Serve
        with vegetables and broth.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cooking Tip</h4>
    <p>Total cook time for corned beef to be fork-tender should be between 45 and 50 minutes per pound. Please adjust if your
    corned beef is larger or smaller than 3 pounds.</p>
