    breakfasts to keep everyone happy.</p>
    <p>Guaranteed to stick to your ribs and last all the way to lunch.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 dash vanilla extract, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl; make a well in the
            center. Beat milk, egg, 2 tablespoons oil, and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl; pour into the well in the
            flour mixture and stir until batter is smooth.</li>
            <li>Drop about 1/4 cup batter per pancake onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4
            minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>These will turn out darker than normal pancakes because of the ingredients for the French toast flavor. They need a slightly more careful eye.</p>
